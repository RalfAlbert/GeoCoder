<p>The Google Maps JavaScript API v3 does not require an API key to function correctly. However, we strongly encourage you to load the Maps API using an APIs Console key which allows you to monitor your application's Maps API usage.</p>
<p>All Maps API applications* should load the Maps API using an API key. Using an API key enables you to monitor your application's Maps API usage, and ensures that Google can contact you about your application if necessary. If your application's Maps API usage exceeds the Usage Limits, you must load the Maps API using an API key in order to purchase additional quota.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Google-Page "<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key">Obtaining an API Key</a>" on how to obtain an API Key.</p>
